This means that whoever was behind the spear-phishing campaign (and thus the DCCC and DNC hacks) also bought the domain name dcleaks.com, and also leased this server.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nHow could U.S. investigators know that Kovalev deleted his search history, as well as records belonging to multiple online accounts? Again, I believe the most likely scenario is that the NSA compromised his computer, accessed his browser history, and perhaps logged his keystrokes and took screenshots from his computer using a C2 server of their own.","meta":"0a5c0640d81c7c7e43fbef7eac46d218","hash":"ef11a433c92c71a13b48ec06493114ec","time":"2018-07-18T19:27:16Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"hacking"},{"href":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/lane-davis-ralph-retort-seattle4truth-alt-right","description":"Alt-Right Troll To Father Killer: The Unraveling Of Lane Davis","extended":"","meta":"e5b70d6d70f979588ddd700f41aa078a","hash":"03c506bff59dfdcb938007a2e1437d11","time":"2018-07-18T13:54:53Z","shared":"yes","toread":"yes","tags":""}]}
