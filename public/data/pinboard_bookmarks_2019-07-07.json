If digits are added or removed from the message during transmission, synchronisation is lost. To restore synchronisation, various offsets can be tried systematically to obtain the correct decryption. Another approach is to tag the ciphertext with markers at regular points in the output.","meta":"f692c6625e85470ed1b38a6790cd1a38","hash":"349b460e39c95fb51d85321d70c9190a","time":"2019-07-07T04:24:28Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"crypto"},{"href":"https://www.booooooom.com/2017/09/14/influential-voices-an-interview-with-john-trippe-fecal-face/","description":"Influential Voices: An Interview With John Trippe (Fecal Face)","extended":"","meta":"0d830839dee0212b4645bc7472df9081","hash":"a5945818d9711643fc512a6382debbb2","time":"2019-07-07T15:46:52Z","shared":"yes","toread":"yes","tags":""}]}
