When we meet, he's wearing an olive hunting shirt with a Desert Oracle iron-on patch; his license plate reads \"D ORACLE.\"\n\nLayne was finally able to revisit the radio show idea this past summer, crafting a 28-minute episode every week (which he says requires about 12 hours of work) and broadcasting it at 10 p.m. on Fridays on a local station in the high desert surrounding Joshua Tree.","meta":"90addd82a902b8f7c830b60ade531e02","hash":"23f301513646161945680d07118d5a96","time":"2019-06-08T03:17:43Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""}]}
