If Kalashnikov hadn’t designed the AK-47 wouldn’t someone else just have designed another rifle? Most assuredly. And they did.

And they all have a designer’s name attached to them. The shit we design carries our name.\r\n\r\nYour role as a designer is to leave the world in a better state than you found it. You have a responsibility to design work that helps move humanity forward and helps us, as a species, to not only enjoy our time on Earth, but to evolve.","meta":"61ea68382c46a499516bcf4f78555be6","hash":"9fb08fdbb55d02de11f3d68b7274fb5a","time":"2019-01-31T18:35:46Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"design"}]}
