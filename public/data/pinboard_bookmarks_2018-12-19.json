The goal of its idealistic creators was to use cutting-edge cartography to better inform the public about the water policy issues confronting the state.","meta":"5909bafec787cc6630097919ad5d36b3","hash":"8cad446e22e96c06cc7e3c0568fc7a1a","time":"2018-12-19T16:44:08Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"inspiration dataviz book"},{"href":"http://linocutboy.com/notes-and-queries/","description":"Getting started with linocut - Equipment - LinocutBoy","extended":"If you are a beginner, I would recommend you get a large v-gouge and a medium u-gouge to start with. The v-gouge is the most versatile as you can cut a variety of width of line, including the finest lines. If you want to cut an even width of line, a u-gouge is easier. You can also use a scalpel to cut a line similar to the v-gouge but you have to cut each side of the line separately. If you want to clear large areas, a wider, flatter gouge will save you time.","meta":"dca753dbe24bbc50f3497d0474276094","hash":"ca95bfde06f08890ecb56a5056e8c20a","time":"2018-12-19T17:16:47Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"linocut resource art"},{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dVtAn3mlOs","description":"Linocut carving and printing - short film by Maarit Hänninen - YouTube","extended":"","meta":"2314c27ea65315151897ae30356f7b9d","hash":"1c621595e46203ef36772e0b388103ab","time":"2018-12-19T17:28:51Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"inspiration art"},{"href":"http://www.sethkhughes.com/fujifilm-x-t1-video-shoot-best-quality/","description":"Fujifilm X-T1 Video: How to shoot the best quality - Seth K.
