He wrote up his findings in the book, “The Age of Missing Information.”\r\n\r\n“We believe that we live in the ‘age of information.’” he writes. “That there has been an information ‘explosion,’ an information ‘revolution.’ While in a certain narrow sense this is the case, in many important ways just the opposite is true. We also live at a moment of deep ignorance, when vital knowledge that humans have always possessed about who we are and where we live seems beyond our reach. An Unenlightenment. An age of missing information.”\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nBut … I want my attention back.\r\n\r\nDid I really have it before Facebook? Thinking back, the early versions of Facebook were adorable. Benign. No tagging. No timelines. Just The Wall. A way to say — Hey, what’s shaking dorm buddy? Poke. No algorithms. A human scale.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nReturning to those (mythical?) halcyon minimalist information days: You could read all of the news in a single day. Grab the two or three papers and read. The information had edges; it could be understood by a single human over one cup of first-wave coffee. Were you insatiable, the library was available to dig deep on the topics of the day.\r\n\r\nIs this being too reductive? Too rose-tinted?\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nAttention is a muscle. It must be exercised. Though, attention is duplicitous — it doesn’t feel like a muscle. And exercising it doesn’t result in an appreciably healthier looking body. But it does result in a sense of grounding, feeling rational, control of your emotions — a healthy mind. Our measuring sticks for life tend to be optimized for material things, things easy to count. Houses, cars, husbands, babies, dollar bills. Attention is immaterial, difficult to track.\r\n\r\nWe deserve our attention.","meta":"594fb3e87866cbaac22b6792d917bd69","hash":"aa404bf55de3d56b49e5c10a61a52ee1","time":"2019-01-02T05:04:57Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""},{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/girl-interrupted?fbclid=IwAR3xlWXMEW7iCMUgiSFgAzbzJjvLBWPXJf2BrD4-x2YfhEkCY8KFKzsrvz4","description":"How Gay Was Sappho? | The New Yorker","extended":"","meta":"7cf0e1810a6c2b71f97fbcc1f43eea01","hash":"96646044a11acd4eb3be67105ec3f3cd","time":"2019-01-02T19:49:00Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""},{"href":"https://niemanreports.org/articles/hyperallergic/","description":"Hyperallergic, at Age 9, Rivals the Arts Journalism of Legacy Media - Nieman Reports","extended":"","meta":"db4b3b13abcac6be62a91e3566bc3688","hash":"e9d1198bf798c9f3e46f9908e446df87","time":"2019-01-02T20:10:45Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""}]}
