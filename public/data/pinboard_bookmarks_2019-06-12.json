He explains that while some tasks at work may fit into a larger, organization plan, the individual worker may not see where their individual task fits it. Second, limited feedback about one's work can reduce motivation and leaves the employee unaware of whether or not they did a good job. When there is little communication of feedback, an employee may not be assigned tasks that challenge them or seem important, which could potentially prevent an opportunity for flow.\r\n\r\n","meta":"73d181a31adb91dcb321867a3b8782c6","hash":"169e3e013313c2cd2bf6b218a1c9f0e5","time":"2019-06-12T13:05:31Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""},{"href":"https://medium.com/@the1mills/how-to-test-your-npm-module-without-publishing-it-every-5-minutes-1c4cb4b369be","description":"How to test your new NPM module without publishing it every 5 minutes","extended":"","meta":"b2b304332d073cd4cb94c57f9f035b0a","hash":"a65fde4a5231f5d7918ac7ca9d20d886","time":"2019-06-12T16:17:31Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"node cli"}]}
