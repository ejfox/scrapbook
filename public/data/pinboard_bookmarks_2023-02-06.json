OpenAI has a less sophisticated model, Curie, that was the predecessor to Davinci. When davinci started failing, we switched over to Curie to try to keep the show running without any downtime. The switch to Curie was what resulted in the inappropriate text being generated. We leverage OpenAI’s content moderation tools, which have worked thus far for the Davinci model, but were not successful with Curie. We’ve been able to identify the root cause of our issue with the Davinci model, and will not be using Curie as a fallback in the future. We hope this sheds a little light on how this happened.”","meta":"756347936bd094701e91fe9ab0ebe420","hash":"c8dafab84ee29d4bf11061ebbac6e087","time":"2023-02-06T19:24:14Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""}]}
