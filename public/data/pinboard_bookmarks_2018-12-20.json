However, we won't be doing anything hugely sophisticated, so advanced knowledge is not required.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be a musician or an expert in music theory to follow this guide. I'm neither of those things. I'm figuring things out as I go and it's perfectly fine if you do too. I believe that this kind of stuff is well within reach for anyone who knows a bit of programming, and you can have a lot of fun with it even if you aren't a musician.","meta":"07419f4c6e15791de7853eceaf93cbcc","hash":"45561d7b52adaa3b5a111cfc899f3c5c","time":"2018-12-20T05:15:26Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"reference howto javascript music"},{"href":"http://www.adultswim.com/streams/off-the-air","description":"Off the Air - Adult Swim Streams","extended":"","meta":"dc7b116a5e6899327872983b45605895","hash":"a8e072ae232a02a3260b9ec2bb21d194","time":"2018-12-20T06:36:54Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"visuals inspiration"}]}
