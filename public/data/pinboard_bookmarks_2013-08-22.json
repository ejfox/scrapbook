There are fewer steps, and it goes quicker.  The only real challenge is keeping the chems at the proper temp (around 102 degrees).  What I did was keep the chems in 500 ml bottles (used Lipton Green Tea bottles, actually) and set those in a small Igloo cooler that I had filled with water, and then put in a cheap ($8) aquarium heater to keep the temps stable.  It worked really well.","meta":"026917005f890869bfc5f6bf135df819","hash":"74032a9e487a882fcfa5f5cc1e32e982","time":"2013-08-22T20:32:22Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"photography"}]}
