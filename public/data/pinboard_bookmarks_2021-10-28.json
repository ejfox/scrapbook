Once dry, place them in a lidded container and add 50/50 water and vinegar. Add enough liquid to just cover the surface. Let sit over night so the clay can absorb the liquid. Once absorbed, give it a stir! If there are any chunks break them up with your fingers or a tool. The consistency should be that of a thick milkshake. The smoother the better. We like to keep ours in a container with a lid so we have it around when we need it. If itâ€™s a little too wet, just let it sit open so some liquid can evaporate.","meta":"b4f4f0d297e151f5d0ab8a110ef4e47f","hash":"969c2ca95b451accb931f89f89155fc7","time":"2021-10-28T20:53:13Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"pottery analog"}]}
