Their harvest of a private commodity from a public space, the San Francisco Bay, led to an opportunity for oyster pirates. Pirates raided the oyster beds at night and sold their take in the Oakland markets in the morning. The public disliked the Southern Pacific and the oyster growers, and liked cheap oysters. As a result, the oyster pirates had considerable public sympathy and police were reluctant to take action against them.","meta":"5c958db75c5e79b0f5fd7082b4523ccd","hash":"18d32dd3c3f91580f535c52c1078bf3e","time":"2019-06-01T23:18:40Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""},{"href":"https://medium.com/@trishsissons/the-oyster-wars-a-real-thing-that-happened-feat-the-dancing-molly-pirate-posse-91fecb34f22b","description":"The Oyster Wars: A Real Thing That Happened, feat. the Dancing Molly Pirate Posse","extended":"While all of the men had disembarked, the Captain’s wife and two daughters were still aboard the ship.
