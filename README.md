# Personal Scrapbook

The goal of this project is to allow myself a mechanism to look through all of the things I collect online; bookmarks, images, small text posts and begin the process of organizing them into themes, ideas, and projects. 

## Weekly increments
A lot of the tooling is based around the idea of weekly increments. I want to be able to look back at a week and see what I was thinking about, what I was reading, and what I was working on â€“ often this is a unit that collects around a theme or idea, even if some projects or ideas span months or years.
